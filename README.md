## Description.
### "React Portfolio". This is my new knowledge put into practice. This portfolio was built with "[React](https://reactjs.org/)". This portfolio contains a simple one page concept layout which I have to create from the file tree that "[React](https://reactjs.org/)" provides when the application was created. This simple layout is composed by a navigation bar at the top, a body in the middle of the page for content, and the footer with some icons that  would lead to external web domains to provide more information about me.
